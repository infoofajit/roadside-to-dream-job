  <h1>(Notes) Class and Constructors</h1>
  <h2>// Question 1 - Explain the difference between a class and an object in JavaScript.</h2>
  <p>
    Explanation: <br>
    A class is a blueprint that defines the structure and behavior of objects. <br>
    Objects are instances of classes that possess properties and methods defined by the class.
  </p>

  <h2>// Question 2 - What’s the Output?</h2>
  <p>
    Explanation: <br>
    The output will be:<br>
    console.log(square.area()); // 25<br>
    console.log(rect.area()); // 24<br>
    Here, `square` and `rect` are instances of the `Rectangle` class, and `area()` calculates their areas accordingly.
  </p>

  <h2>// Question 3 - How does inheritance work in JavaScript classes?</h2>
  Explanation: <br>
  Inheritance in JavaScript classes is achieved using the `extends` keyword.<br>
  It allows a subclass (child class) to inherit properties and methods from a superclass (parent class).

  <h2>// Question 4 - What’s the Output?</h2>
  Explanation: <br>
  The code will result in an error: `Uncaught SyntaxError: A class may only have one constructor`.<br>
  JavaScript classes can only have one constructor, so having multiple constructor declarations in the `Employee` class causes a syntax error.

  <h2>// Question 5 - Which approach is better and why?</h2>
  Explanation: <br>
  The second approach is better because it registers the `getFullName` method in the prototype, making it more memory-efficient than the first approach, which creates a closure for each object containing the method.

  <h2>// Question 6 - Implement this -</h2>
  Explanation: <br>
  The `Calculator` class defines methods for basic arithmetic operations (`add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, `divide`) and returns the result after each operation.<br>
  Method chaining is used to perform multiple operations in sequence.

  <h2>// Question 7 - Inheritance and Polymorphism</h2>
  Explanation: <br>
  The `Shape` class has an `area()` method that returns 0 by default.<br>
  Subclasses `Circle` and `Square` inherit from `Shape` and override the `area()` method to calculate their respective areas (circle's area using πr^2 formula and square's area using side * side formula).

  <h2>// Question 8 - What are Getters and Setters in JS?</h2>
  Explanation: <br>
  Getters and setters are methods used to control access to the properties of a class.<br>
  They allow for more controlled modification and retrieval of property values, such as incrementing likes in a video or ensuring certain conditions are met before setting a property value.
