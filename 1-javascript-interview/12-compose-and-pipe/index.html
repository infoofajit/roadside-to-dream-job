  <h1>(Notes) Compose and Pipe</h1>
  <h2>Question: What is the purpose of the compose and pipe functions in JavaScript?</h2>

  Explanation: <br>
  - compose and pipe are higher-order functions used for function composition in JavaScript.<br>
  - compose takes multiple functions as arguments and returns a new function that applies these functions from right to left.<br>
  - pipe, on the other hand, applies the functions from left to right.<br>
  - Both compose and pipe are commonly used in functional programming to create new functions by combining existing ones in a specific order.
