  <h1>(Notes) Prototypes</h1>
  <h2>Ques 1: What will be the output of the following code?</h2>
  Explanation: The output will be: <br>
  Driving a vehicle<br>
  Driving a car<br>

  This is because vehicle.drive() invokes the drive() method from the Vehicle prototype, while car.drive() invokes the overridden drive() method in the Car prototype.

  <h2>Ques 2: Explain the difference between __proto__ and prototype in JavaScript.</h2>
  Explanation:<br>
      __proto__: It points to the prototype of an object and is used for inheritance and accessing the prototype chain.<br>
      prototype: It exists on constructor functions to set up inheritance for objects created by that function, defining shared properties and methods for instances.

  <h2>Ques 3: What is setPrototypeOf?</h2>
  Explanation: setPrototypeOf is a method used to set the prototype (the object's internal [[Prototype]]) of a specified object to another object or null. It allows changing the prototype dynamically after an object has been created.

  <h2>Ques 4: What is instanceof?</h2>
  Explanation: instanceof is an operator that checks if an object is an instance of a specific constructor or its prototype chain. It returns true if the object is an instance of the constructor or a constructor's prototype chain.

  <h2>Ques 5: How can you create an object without a prototype in JavaScript?</h2>
  Explanation: You can create an object without a prototype by using Object.create(null). This creates an object with no prototype chain, making it free from any inherited properties or methods.

  <h2>Ques 6: What will be the output of the following code?</h2>
  Explanation: The output will be:<br>
  10<br>
  20<br>
  30<br>

  This is because obj1 is an instance of A with foo as 10, obj2 is an instance of B with foo as 20 (overridden from A), and obj3 is an instance of C with foo as 30 (overridden from both A and B).

  <h2>Ques 7: Deep Clone an object in JS</h2>
  Explanation: The deepClone function recursively creates a deep copy of an object, including nested objects and arrays, ensuring that the cloned object is completely independent of the original object.
