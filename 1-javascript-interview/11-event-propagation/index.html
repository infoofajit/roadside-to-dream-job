  <h1>(Notes) Event Propagation</h1>
  <h2>Question 1: Event Bubbling</h2>
  Explanation: Event bubbling refers to the propagation of an event from the innermost target element to the outermost ancestor. In the provided code, clicking on the button will also trigger the click event on the form and div elements due to event bubbling.

  <h2>Question 2: event.target vs this.target vs event.currentTarget</h2>
  Explanation: event.target refers to the element that triggered the event, this refers to the element to which the event listener is attached (i.e., the current context), and event.currentTarget refers to the element that is currently handling the event during its capture or bubbling phase.

  <h2>Question 3: Event Capturing</h2>
  Explanation: Event capturing is the opposite of event bubbling, where the event is captured from the outermost element towards the target element. By setting {capture: true}, event listeners are triggered during the capturing phase instead of the bubbling phase.

  <h2>Question 4: Stop Propagation</h2>
  Explanation: event.stopPropagation() prevents the further propagation of an event through the DOM tree. In the provided code, clicking on the form element will not trigger the click event on the div element due to event.stopPropagation() being called.

  <h2>Question 5: Event Delegation</h2>
  Explanation: Event delegation is a technique where a parent element listens for events on behalf of its children. In this code, the parent element with the class "products" listens for click events and checks if the clicked target is a span element, redirecting to a specific URL based on the span's class.

  <h2>Question 6: What is the Output?</h2>
  Explanation: The output depends on which element is clicked. If the div or button is clicked, it will alert "div" or "button" respectively. However, if the form is clicked, it will first trigger the capturing phase (alerting "form") before the bubbling phase (alerting "form" again).

  <h2>Question 7: Create a Modal which closes by clicking on negative space</h2>
  Explanation: This code sets up a modal that becomes visible when a button with the class "modalButton" is clicked. Clicking on the modal container (the area outside the modal content) will hide the modal by toggling its display property between "flex" and "none".
